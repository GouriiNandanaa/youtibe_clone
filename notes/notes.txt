Nested layouts are the important topic in a website
here there are 2 types of layouts mainly
They are:
  verical layouts
  horizontal layouts


with these 2 layouts we can do anything
for this youtube


first take a screenshort of any thumbnail
then crop it
google drawings 
upload the pic
then shapes >rectangles

draw a rectangles then change the thickness and the color

vertical is not cutting vertically, its horizontal splitting and arranging something vertically

divide that as much as you could using different color for horizontal and vertical 


in this fig , there are actually 2 horizontal layouts
so make that contents separately to div



a MUCH Better way to create the horizontal and verical grids is that to use the grid layout technique 

for putting elements in a horizontal alignment side by side , we will use display property to inline block and will specify the width

the problem with the inline block element is some alignment issues


css grids can be used for creating perfect horizontal layouts
